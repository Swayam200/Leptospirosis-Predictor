### How to Run this
1. Download weather data from Google Drive Link above. Extract the Zip File and place it in the project directory along with other contents. Do not change any file names.  
2. Download and Run combining_w_weather_data.ipynb
3. Download health_data_cleaned.csv and run the making_ml_data.ipynb
4. Your final output would be ml_data.csv, I have also attached the ml_data.csv in case you do not wish to perform the EDA process. You can verify the contents of both the files to be sure of the validity of the data.
