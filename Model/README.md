# 🧠 Model
## 🚀 How to Run the Model
Follow these steps to train and use the model for predictions:

* Navigate to the model folder.
* Train the Model:
* Open Lepto.py and run it.
* The trained model will be saved as Trainedmodel.pkl.
* Make Predictions:
* Open Predict.py and execute it.
* The .pkl file will be loaded automatically.
* Predictions will be generated based on the trained model.

## 📊 Model Performance
The R² (R-squared) score, which measures the goodness of fit, should ideally be close to 1 for a perfect model.
Our model achieves an R² score of 0.833, indicating strong predictive performance.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ✅ Model Validation
To evaluate the model, compare its predictions with real-world data. If necessary, fine-tune the training parameters to improve accuracy.
